# Changes in version 4.0

## Service Plugin

- The `mergeInstance` mutation has been removed and replaced with the `merge` mutation.
- When using `intance.clone` and `instance.commit` instance methods, es5 accessors (getters and setters) must be defined directly on the model. If accessors are defined in instanceDefaults, they will not always remain available after using `clone` and `commit`.

## useFind

- The `lazy` option has been replaced by the `immediate` option.  `immediate` is `true` by default, so you can set `{ immediate: false }` in the options to not fire the watcher right away.  The same change has been made for the `useGet` utility.

## useGet

- The `lazy` option has been replaced by the `immediate` option.  `immediate` is `true` by default, so you can set `{ immediate: false }` in the options to not fire the watcher right away.  The same change has been made for the `useFind` utility.
